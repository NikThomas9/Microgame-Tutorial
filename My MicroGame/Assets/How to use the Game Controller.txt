You can call these functions in any script at any time:

Functions you can call:

GameController.Instance.WinGame() will tell the GameController that the player has won the game.

GameController.Instance.LoseGame() will tell the GameController that the player has lost the game.


Properties you can access (these are read-only, you cannot modify them):

GameController.Instance.gameDifficulty can either be 1, 2, or 3, and is meant to signify the current level of difficulty.

GameController.Instance.gameTime tells you the amount of seconds that have passed since the game has started. If gameTime reaches
20 seconds, player will automatically lose the game.


Properties you can access (these can be written AND read):

GameController.Instance.gamePoints is the current number of points the player has.


Fairly useless properties that you can still read anyways:

GameController.Instance.maxFails is the number of times that a player can lose before it's game over.

GameController.Instance.gameFails is the number of times the player has lost games.

GameController.Instance.gameWins is the number of times the player has won games.
